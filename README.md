Hey everyone!

My name is Chris, I'm a noobie in the world of Pentesting and Cybersecurity but I'm learning and making my way up the ladder as much as I can.

I'm a Cybersecurity student with an interest in offensive security methodologies and scripting. I mainly focus on Python with a bit of VBScript and currently learning JScript and PowerShell.

Don't hesitate to reach out!
